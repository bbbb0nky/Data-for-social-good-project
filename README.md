# Data-for-social-good-project
for CSA unit 3

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## Requirements 

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program: 
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors. 
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about. 
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs. 
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset). 
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions. 

## User Story 

Include your User Story you analyzed for your project here. Your User Story should have the following format: 

> As anew record shop business owner, <br> 
> I want to have successful record shop business, <br> 
> so that I can make a lot of money and become successful. 

## Dataset 

Include a hyperlink to the source of your dataset used for this project. Additionally, provide a short description of each column used from the dataset, and the data type. 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelbryantds/top-5000-albums-of-all-time-rateyourmusiccom
 
- **Album** (String) - name of the album 
- **Artist** (String) - name of the artist 
- **Genre** (String) - name of the genre(s) within the album 

## UML Diagram 

Put and image of your UML Diagram here. Upload the image of your UML Diagram to your repository, then use the Markdown syntax to insert your image here. Make sure your image file name is one work, otherwise it might not properly get display on this README.

## Description 

Write a description of your project here. In your description, include as many vocab words from our class to explain your User Story, the chosen dataset and how your project addressed that users goals. If your project used the Scanner class for user input, explain how the user will interact with your project.

Our user, in this project, owns a record shop business and wants it to be successful. in order to do this, the user must look for what genres make an album popular and what artist makes the most popular albums. The dataset chosen is from kaggle, called top 5000 albums of all time. This dataset will address the user's goals by allowing the user to view what makes the album popular, therefore knowing what to stock up in. This project includes a scanner class, which allows the user to input info to see what and how many albums are made by the artist inputted or how many albums have a certain genre.
